	"content": "What is Raspberry Pi (RPI)? The Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer capable of doing almost everything that an ordinary Linux-based computer can do. Once it connects to an HDMI display, a keyboard, and a mouse, we have have a fully functional computer for a pice of $35 (or even way less for the Raspberry Pi Zero). The Raspberry Pi is widely known and used for home lab environments, where anyone can experiment safely. To learn more about Raspberry Pi.\nNote that we will need to purchase a microSD card with a capacity of at least 8GB. We will also need a power supply to power the Raspberry Pi via USB-C for Raspberry Pi 4.\nRaspberry Pi 4 There are several models of RPI, and for most people Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the one to choose. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the newest, fastest, and easiest to use.\nRaspberry Pi 4 comes with 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB of RAM. For most educational purposes and hobbyist projects, and for use as a desktop computer, 2GB is enough.\nRaspberry Zero Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero W, and Raspberry Pi Zero WH are smaller and require less power, so they’re useful for portable projects such as robots. It’s generally easier to start a project with Raspberry Pi 4, and to move to Raspberry Pi Zero when you have a working prototype that a smaller Raspberry Pi would be useful for.\nUnpacking and Assembling My First Raspberry Pi 4 I purchased the latest Raspberry Pi 4 from Amazon which rocks a 1.5GHz 64-bit quad-core (ARMv8) CPU (4GB of RAM)—though you can step up to 8GB of RAM for a bit more money. Moreover, 2.4 Ghz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE. It is very powerful for pretty little thing.\nI have had the starter kit with my RPI 4 which includes premium case with integrated fan mount, 3.5A USB-C power supply with on/off power switch, set of heat sinks, micro HDMI to HDMI cable and 32 GB microSD card.\nThis is my RPI 4 after being fully assembled.\nWe will need a keyboard, a monitor and a mouse for the initial setup. However, we might not need them down the road. It depends on the project and how we are going to access the RPI 4.\nInstall an Operating System on the microSD Card The RPI operating system (previously called Raspbian) is the Foundation\u0026rsquo;s official OS for the Pi based on Debian Linux. The Pi Foundation also offers a Raspberry Pi Imager for a quick and easy way to install Raspberry PI OS and other operating systems to our microSD card. It\u0026rsquo;s available for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu. Let\u0026rsquo;s download the Raspberry Pi Imager.\nFor our upcoming projects, I would suggest to install 64-bit Ubuntu Desktop 20.10 on the RPI instead of the 32-bit Raspbian operating system.\nAfter downloading the Raspberry Pi Imager, we will click on \u0026ldquo;CHOOSE OS\u0026rdquo; to select the Ubuntu Desktop 20.10 on our microSD card.\nIf the downloading process to the microSD is completed successfully, we shall see the below message.\n"

	"content": "What is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS? Ubuntu is a complete Linux operating system. It is available with both community and professional support. The Ubuntu community should be available free of charge and people should have the freedom to customize it. To learn more about Ubuntu.\nPlease note that some parts of the images in this tutorial will be pixilated to hide all personal information such as account numbers, ip addresses and any other personal or sensitive information.\n\rIn order to complete this tutorial, you will access to an AWS account. Therefore, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have an AWS account, you should sign up and create an account. AWS offers a 12-month free tier account. With this free-trier account, AWS gives you 750 hrs/monthly of EC2 computing service in a single Availability Zone and t2.micro instance. If we have one instance running 24hrs X 31 days = 744 hrs, which is still below the AWS free-tier account limit of 750 hrs/monthly. Basically, you would have one EC2 instance running for an entire year for free.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re logged in and on the home page, as shown below, make sure you select the region to where you want to spin your instance. Us East-1 (N. Virginia) is selected in my case. Then, click on EC2 under the Compute section.\nClick on Launch Instance On EC2 Dashboard\nChoose AMI (Amazon Machine Image) Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. You might need to scroll down to find Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\nChoose Instance Type as General purpose t2.micro. This is the instance type identified by AWS for the Free-Tier account eligibility. Now click on Configure Instance Details\nOn the Configure Instance Details, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to make any changes. However, ensure that all selections are similar to what is on the below image.\nOn Add Storage screen is where we can increase the storage size of the instance. AWS permits up to 30GB for free-tier accounts. Let\u0026rsquo;s take advantage of it. I increased mine to 16 GB, you could use more if you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nIt is always a good practice and good a habit to have when it comes to adding tags. Since I have multiple Ubuntu instances, I would like to dedicate this to Portainer. You could tag your instance under any name you would like.\nConfigure Security Group is where we create security groups and specify Ports to open for the EC2 instance. Note that we will only ports that will allow us to install and run Portainer for now. We will open more ports down the road based on the ports required by the web application we will run.\nBe very careful when you open ports to the world.\nOn Create a new security group, name your security group and give it a description.\nThese are the two ports we need to open at this stage.\n   Type Port     SSH 22   Custom TCP 9000    The final stage of this process is Review Instance Launch. Once you have reviewed the instance configurations, click on Launch.\nWe will create a key pair to connect (SSH) to our EC2 instance from our local machine. Let us download the Key Pair and keep it in a secure location. Without this key, we will not be abe to connect to the EC2 instance.\nA key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an instance. Amazon EC2 stores the public key, and you store the private key. You use the private key, instead of a password, to securely access your instances. Anyone who possesses your private keys can connect to your instances, so it\u0026rsquo;s important that you store your private keys in a secure place. To read more about a key pair from AWS.\nClick on Launch Instance\nLet\u0026rsquo;s wait until the Instance State is updated to \u0026ldquo;running\u0026rdquo; status. The running status \u0026ldquo;Green\u0026rdquo; is indication that our EC2 instance is fully provisioned and ready to be connected to.\nConclusion: This concludes the first section of part one of the tutorial. We have successfully spun a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS EC2 instance. In the next section, we will learn how to SSH into the instance.\n"

	"content": "What is Portainer? Portainer is the definitive open source container management tool for Kubernetes, Docker, Docker Swarm and Azure ACI. It allows anyone to deploy and manage containers without the need to write codes. To learn more about Portainer.\nUpdating the Operating System Now, we have a secured connection with our instance, let\u0026rsquo;s update and upgrade the operating system. Updating and upgrading the operating system of the instance is always a good habit to have. We will run the following update/upgrade commands. The -y in the end of the command line will automatically enters \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; as a confirmation before installing the updates.\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y\rCleaning up after an update If this is not the packges first time to run an update, there might have some unnecessary packages left for cleaning. Removing these packages will free space and prevent your system from cluttering. The following command shall do the job.\nsudo apt autoremove\rStep 1: Install Docker If always want to automatically get the latest version of Docker on Ubuntu, you must add its official repository to Ubuntu system. To do that, run the commands below to install prerequisite packages:\nsudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common\rNext, run the commands below to download and install Docker’s official GPG key. The key is used to validate packages installed from Docker’s repository making sure they’re trusted.\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\rsudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88\rThe response would be like this:\nResponse:\rpub rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]\r9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88\ruid [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) \u0026lt;docker@docker.com\u0026gt;\rsub rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]\rNow that the official GPG key is installed, run the commands below to add its stable repository to Ubuntu. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below.\nsudo add-apt-repository \u0026quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\u0026quot;\rAfter this command, Docker’s official GPG and repository should be installed on Ubuntu. If you have older versions of Docker, run the commands below to remove them:\nsudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc\rWhen you have removed all the previous versions of Docker, run the commands below to install the latest and current stable version of Docker: To install specific version of Docker, run the apt-cache command. Then select the version to install.\napt-cache madison docker-ce\rOutput:\rdocker-ce | 5:19.03.12~3-0~ubuntu-focal | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal/stable amd64 Packages\rdocker-ce | 5:19.03.11~3-0~ubuntu-focal | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal/stable amd64 Packages\rdocker-ce | 5:19.03.10~3-0~ubuntu-focal | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal/stable amd64 Packages\rdocker-ce | 5:19.03.9~3-0~ubuntu-focal | https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal/stable amd64 Packages\r....\rNow to install a specific version, run the commands below with the version you wish to install:\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce=5:19.03.10~3-0~ubuntu-focal docker-ce-cli=5:19.03.10~3-0~ubuntu-focal containerd.io\rIf you just want to latest version without specifying above, run the commands below. The command below will always install the highest possible version:\nsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\rThis will install Docker software on Ubuntu. Add your account, for most cases it will be ubuntu, to Docker group and restart:\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\rReboot your instance:\nsudo reboot\rTo verify that Docker CE is installed correctly you can run the hello-world image:\nsudo docker run hello-world\rIf Docker is installed correctly you will see the following response:\nResponse:\rHello from Docker!\rThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\rTo generate this message, Docker took the following steps:\r1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\r2. The Docker daemon pulled the \u0026quot;hello-world\u0026quot; image from the Docker Hub.\r(amd64)\r3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\rexecutable that produces the output you are currently reading.\r4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\rto your terminal.\rStep 2: Install Docker Compose On Ubuntu Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the Compose repository release page on GitHub.\nTo install it, run the commands below to download version 1.28.5 As of this writing, this was the current version.\nsudo curl -L \u0026quot;https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\u0026quot; -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\rTo install a different version of Compose, substitute 1.28.5 with the version of Compose you want to use.\nAfter downloading it, run the commands below to apply executable permissions to the binary file and create a symbolic link to /usr/binary\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\rsudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose\rNow, Docker Compose should work. To test it, we will run the command below:\ndocker-compose --version\rYou should see similar output as below:\nResponse:\rdocker-compose version 1.28.5, build 0aa59064\rStep 3: Setup Portainer Now that Docker and Docker Composer are installed, follow the steps below to get Portainer setup.\nYou can use Docker command to deploy the Portainer Server; note the agent is not needed on standalone hosts, however, it does provide additional functionality if used.\nTo get the server installed, run the commands below.\ncd ~/\rdocker volume create portainer_data\rdocker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer\rYou’ll just need to access the port 9000 of the Docker engine where Portainer is running using your browser.\nNote: the -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock option can be used in Linux environments only.\nAfter a successful pull, you should get a similar message as below:\nlatest: Pulling from portainer/portainer\rd1e017099d17: Pull complete a7dca5b5a9e8: Pull complete Digest: sha256:4ae7f14330b56ffc8728e63d355bc4bc7381417fa45ba0597e5dd32682901080\rStatus: Downloaded newer image for portainer/portainer:latest\r2fd5f4a0883a9d358ad424fd963699445be8839f3e6a2cf73d55778bcc268523\rAt this point, all you need to do is access Portainer portal to manage Docker. Open your web browser and browse to the server’s hostname or IP address followed by port #9000\nhttp://localhost:9000 or http://your_EC2_instance_public_ip_adress:9000\nYou should get Portainer login page to create an admin password.\nSubmit a new password.\nNow, you see some options to choose the environment you want to manage. Since we installed Docker on the same instance, select to connect and manage Docker locally.\nYou’ll be directed to Portainer dashboard where you can start managing Docker. If you see a notification for upgrade, click on it and proceed with the upgrade process.\nConclusion: By the end of this tutorial, we have successfully installed Portainer Docker management tool on our Ubuntu 20.04 EC2 instance. In part 3 of this tutorial, we will learn how to install and run a Wordpress web application.\n"

All user authentication, commands, output, and file transfers are encrypted to protect against attacks in the network. There are many tools available to establish SSH connection such as, PuTTy and WinSCP for Windows, CyberDuck for MacOS, OpenSSH for Unix and Linux and many other great tools.\nI would suggest we utilize AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) version 2. The AWS CLI is a open source powerful tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your local machine command line shell. In my case, I\u0026rsquo;m using AWS CLI version 2 from within my Windows Command Prompt. Please, follow the installation process as documented by AWS based on your machine type (local device).\nWith this brief introduction about SSH, we will proceed with tutorial from where have stopped. Next, let’s get to actually logging into our Ubuntu EC2 instance. To do so, you’ll have to open Terminal of the SSH tool, which you have chosen to use. As I have previously stated, I have downloaded AWS CLI v2 ;therefore, I will run Command Line (Command Prompt) on Windows.\nOn CL, the first to do is change the directory using the command cd into the directory/folder where we have saved our key pair (pem file). This is the file we have downloaded in Part 1 tutorial.\nExample:\ncd C:\\Users\\Omar\\XXXXX\\Documents\\XXX\\AWS\\XXXX\rcd C:\\your full URL where you have saved the pem file for the instance\u0026gt;\rBack to the AWS console and on the Instances section, let select our Ubuntu instance and then click on Actions \u0026gt; Connect button.\nThen, let\u0026rsquo;s click on the third tab, SSH Client, and copy the SSH command line by clicking on the copy icon as shown below. This command has combined our pem file name, ssh command and our instance public domain name.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s paste this command on our CL or your chosen SSH tool and click enter.

Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # If set, this will be used for the page\u0026#39;s menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Set the page as a chapter, changing the way it\u0026#39;s displayed chapter = false # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a pre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the Github icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Github repo\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026#34; +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;My page\u0026#34; weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, Hugo-theme-learn will use a page\u0026rsquo;s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page\u0026rsquo;s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Install on Linux\u0026#34; menuTitle = \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; +++ Homepage To configure your home page, you basically have three choices:\n Create an _index.md document in content folder and fill the file with Markdown content Create an index.html file in the static folder and fill the file with HTML content Configure your server to automatically redirect home page to one your documentation page  "

Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes\u0026hellip;)\n\rLet\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\n Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use!  John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\n The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. \u0026ndash; John Gruber\n Grav ships with built-in support for Markdown and Markdown Extra. You must enable Markdown Extra in your system.yaml configuration file\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nBookmark this page for easy future reference!\n\rHeadings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;h1 Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements.

For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026quot;The Dojocat\u0026quot;\r Resizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.

The included package supports 38 common languages, as described on the highlight.js download page.\nIdentifying failed language detection Highlight will write a warning to the browser console if a requested language was not found. For example, the following code block references an imaginary language foo. An error will be output to the console on this page.\n```foo bar ``` Could not find the language 'foo', did you forget to load/include a language module?(anonymous) @ highlight.pack.js\rSupporting additional languages To support languages other than the 38 common languages included in the default highlight.js you will need to download your own version of highlight.js and add it to your site content.\nDownload custom highlight.js Visit https://highlightjs.org/download/ and select your desired language support. Note that more languages means greater package size.\nAdd custom highlight.js to static resources Inside the zip archive downloaded from highlight.js extract the file named highlight.pack.js. Move this file to the new location\nstatic/js/highlight.pack.js\rDo not replace the existing file at themes/hugo-theme-learn/static/js/highlight.pack.js.\nIncluding the file in the correct path will override the theme default highlight.pack.js and prevent issues caused in the future if the theme default file is updated.\nFurther usage information See https://highlightjs.org/usage/\n"
