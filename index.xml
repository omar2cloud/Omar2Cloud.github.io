      <description>What is Raspberry Pi (RPI)? The Raspberry Pi is a small single-board computer capable of doing almost everything that an ordinary Linux-based computer can do. Once it connects to an HDMI display, a keyboard, and a mouse, we have have a fully functional computer for a pice of $35 (or even way less for the Raspberry Pi Zero). The Raspberry Pi is widely known and used for home lab environments, where anyone can experiment safely.</description>

      <description>What is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC)? VNC is a graphical desktop sharing system that allows you to remotely control the desktop interface from another computer or mobile device (running VNC Viewer). VNC Viewer transmits the keyboard and the mouse events to VNC Server, and receives updates to the screen in return. Setting up a VNC Server on our RPI 4 is very beneficial to gain access to it from another device.</description>

      <description>What is a X11VNC Server? The Virtual Network Computing (VNC) allows to view and interact with devices remotely with any VNC viewer. When working with multiple RPIs, having VNC servers give us access all our RPIs from one device. There are many VNC servers and X11VNC is one of them. On another tutorial, we will install RealVNC, which is another vnc server. I will go over why do we need to install X11VNC on Ubuntu and RealVNC on RPI OS.</description>

      <guid>https://omar2cloud.github.io/rasp/pi/headless/</guid>
      <description>What is Headless? Headless is the term used when we run our RPI without a monitor or a keyboard. I like to setup and configure my RPI using a monitor at least for the first time only, but if we are hosting a server with no desktop GUI on a RPI, setting up headless is the way to go.
Please, refer to Raspberry Pi Foundation for information on how to setup RPI headless</description>

      <description>What is AWS Lambda? AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service, which allow the user to run codes without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, the user does not manage runtimes nor admin the server. Utilizing Lambda is as simple as uploading a code in a ZIP file or a container image, and Lambda automatically allocates compute execution power and runs the code based on the incoming request or event. Lambda functions can be written in many flavors such as, Node.</description>

The default path is to send all the traffic to a given Target Group.. Usually a TG comprises of infrastructure components either on the cloud (EC2 instances) or from on-prem data-center (via IP).
However, there is an exciting feature by which the target group can contain a lambda function as the backend.</description>

      <description>Resetting Admin password in Portainer running as container Portainer does not have a password reset feature. We will have to you use a password container helper.
1- Firstly, we will stop the Portainer container.
docker container stop portainer2- We will run the helper using the same bind-mount/volume for the data volume
docker run --rm -v portainer_data:/data portainer/helper-reset-passwordThe response should be similar to the below.
2020/06/04 00:13:58 Password succesfully updated for user: admin2020/06/04 00:13:58 Use the following password to login: &amp;amp;_4#\3^5V8vLTd)E&amp;quot;NWiJBs26G*9HPl13- Finally, we will restart the Portainer container.</description>

      <description>This page is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes&amp;hellip;)
Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.
Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.</description>

      <description>Learn theme uses highlight.js to provide code syntax highlighting.
Markdown syntax Wrap the code block with three backticks and the name of the language. Highlight will try to auto detect the language if one is not provided.
```json [ { &amp;#34;title&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;apples&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;count&amp;#34;: [12000, 20000], &amp;#34;description&amp;#34;: {&amp;#34;text&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;...&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;: false} }, { &amp;#34;title&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;oranges&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;count&amp;#34;: [17500, null], &amp;#34;description&amp;#34;: {&amp;#34;text&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;...&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;: false} } ] ``` Renders to:
